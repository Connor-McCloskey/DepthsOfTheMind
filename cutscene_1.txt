Once again, you're plunged into darkness. "Excellent!" the voice of Dr. Sorola calls out. "One down! It looks like the memory is coming through. You may experience some residual information from it. Keep up the good work, Mr. Blumenfeld, we'll have you up on your feet in no time!"

A warmth washes over you as the voice of your daughter echoes out of the black. "Will he be okay?"

"I don't know," your wife says. At first you think they're in the room with Dr. Sorola, but you quickly realize that this feels different than the god-like voice of the VR system - this must be the memory, some time they were in your room while you were out.

"Good riddance," your daughter says. Alarm and indignation zaps down your arms and chest at her flippant attitude.

"Sarah!" your wife exclaims.

"Don't give me that look, mom. He was never there to begin with, and when he was, it's not like he was much of a dad. He's about as present now as he was then. Hell, at least while he's like this he can't berate me for not meeting his expectations."

Silence overtakes them. Eventually, you wife says softly: "He loves you, Sarah. I hope you know that."

"Yeah? Well, he's got a funny way of showing it." You hear the sound of Sarah turning to leave, the sound of each footstep echoing in this black space. She pauses at the door. "You need anything, mom, let me know, okay?"

There was no reply. You can feel yourself being pulled back into the VR space, the sound of your wife quietly sobbing echoing around you...

Press space to continue...
