Awareness returns to you. You are surrounded in darkness, as if you were in the darkest depths of the ocean.

"Mr. Blumenfeld?" a female voice calls out. "Good! Looks like you can hear me. I'm Dr. Sorola. How are you feeling?"

"Where am I?" you weakly ask.

"Well, it's...complicated," the voice replies. "You've been in a coma for some time. I don't imagine you remember the accident..."

Your thoughts turn to your family - your wife, your daughter - and panic begins to wardrum beat in your chest. You remember all too well.

"The good news, however, is that we have an experimental treatment we'd like to run you through, if you're up to it," Dr. Sorola continues. "We have you wired up to a VR system that will allow you to perceive your brain as a computerized environment. Our work suggests that by presenting your injuries as gamified obstacles in this way, you may be able escape your coma."

"What would I need to do?" you ask.

"We have to run you through each lobe of your brain, starting with the cerebellum. In each environment, if you search hard enough, you'll find a memory, information recorded by your unconscious brain during your coma that we can use to exit one lobe, into another, and hopefully once we've looped through your whole brain, back out into the real world. These will present themselves as blue-and-white squares. Find them, and we can get you back up on your feet! Are you ready?"

"Of course!" you say, your nerves and memories of your family driving you forward. "Let's go already!"

"Very well," Dr. Sorola says. "A word of caution - your brain may try to reject this procedure and the equipment we're using to pull this off. Beware of that. If you see anything strange, or hear a wind, be prepared to catch yourself. We'll reboot you to a "save point" if you fall, but if you're careful we can get you back out a lot sooner. Okay? Here we go..."
